PowerOfPeace
============

A browsergame where you try to depose or protect the president in a nonviolent revolution. Relive it all from Ghandi to Singing Revolution to the Arab Spring!

This is a game of nonviolent revolution. The aim is to depose a
tyrannical president. You are one of the people organising the revolution. Take 
over the city and the presidential palace. Some players are traitors and 
counter-revolutionaries, find them and block them or they will block the drive 
for justice and freedom! They can also attempt to conspire against our ideals 
and turn conflicts into violence. The people cannot win if there is violence,
so end conflict as soon as possible to bring a new government to power.
